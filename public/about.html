<h2>About Me</h2>
<p>
  Hello! I'm Omar Mohamed Mahmoud Ismail, a passionate and curious computer
  science student currently studying at the Faculty of Computer Science and
  Artificial Intelligence. I have a deep love for programming, especially in
  languages like Python, Java, and HTML, and I'm always excited to explore new
  technologies and build creative, meaningful projects.
</p>

<p>
  My journey into the world of tech began with a fascination for how things work
  behind the screen, and since then, I've been diving deeper into areas like
  object-oriented programming, web development, and even machine learning.
  Whether it’s creating interactive interfaces or solving real-world problems
  through code, I find joy in turning ideas into reality.
</p>

<p>
  Outside of coding, I'm a cat lover and proud cat dad to two amazing furballs —
  Simba and Lucy. I also enjoy watching thought-provoking films, playing
  strategy games, and constantly learning through online resources and hands-on
  experimentation. I believe in continuous growth and love working on projects
  that challenge me and help others.
</p>

<p>
  I'm always open to collaboration, internships, or simply connecting with
  like-minded people in tech. If you're interested in my work or want to build
  something cool together, feel free to reach out!
</p>
